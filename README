 What is guacamole-server-docker?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-server-docker is provides a Dockerfile for the
guacamole-server project, the core server-side proxy used by the Guacamole web
application.

Although intended to become the officially-maintained Dockerfile for the
guacamole-server portion of the Guacamole project, this is our first adventure
into the world of Docker, and is thus experimental. Once it proves itself,
this will be adopted within the Glyptodon repositories, and become part of
each Guacamole release, not to mention officially-documented.
